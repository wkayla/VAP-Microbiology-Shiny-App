# VAP-Microbiology-Shiny-App

**Background**

This code builds and deploys the shiny app built to display cohort characteristics and subject specific reports for the population found in the 2021 paper "Temporal Airway Microbiome Changes Related to Ventilator Associated Pneumonia in Children" (Mourani et. al.). App was built and deployed initially in 2019 and lives here:https://wkayla.shinyapps.io/subject_specific/.
